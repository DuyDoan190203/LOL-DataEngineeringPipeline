# Simple ETL data pipeline for LOL rank matches
### Introduction
League of lengends is one of my favorite game so i think why dont i start figuring out how to do something with the data for it. It turns out that some online sources already did the best dashboards i could imagine. However, I thought that there could always be more queries to be run to explore data from some other angle. As a Lol player, I would like to see the statistics about different rank matches to analyze and come up with some strategies for my own game.
